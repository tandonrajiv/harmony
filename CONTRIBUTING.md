## Coding style

**Do**:

    * 2 spaces indent for all the files.
    * Keep newline at EOF.
    * Use newlines liberally to visually separate logical blocks of code.

**Don't**:

    * Don't mix tabs and spaces.
    * Don't use comma-first coding style.
    * Do not, at whatever cost, leave trailing whitespaces. Fix your editor if needed.

**Commits**

    * Give proper commit messages that describe the change.
    * Each commit message should be granular, solving a specific issue.
    * Don't mangle a lot of commits together, unless asked for.
    * Use GFM in commit messages to link to issues if they are related.
    * Use a short summary on the first line.
    * Use Markdown in commit messages to make them more readable.
    * Wrap commit message lines at 80 chars.

**Pull requests**

    * Ensure that you have worked on the latest code to avoid re-introducing removed diffs.
    * Give a proper title to your pull requests.
    * Giving a description will make the aliens smile.
    * Giving a description is no excuse to commit messages that make aliens sad.
